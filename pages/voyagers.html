              >The Voyager program is an American scientific program that
              employs two interstellar probes, Voyager 1 and Voyager 2. They
              were launched in 1977 to take advantage of a favorable alignment
              of the two gas giants Jupiter and Saturn and the ice giants,
              Uranus and Neptune, to fly near them while collecting data for
              transmission back to Earth. After launch, the decision was made to
              send Voyager 2 near Uranus and Neptune to collect data for
              transmission back to Earth.</span
            >
            <span
              >As of 2024, the Voyagers are still in operation beyond the outer
              boundary of the heliosphere in interstellar space. They collect
              and transmit useful data to Earth.</span

            <span
              >Voyager did things no one predicted, found scenes no one
              expected, and promises to outlive its inventors. Like a great
              painting or an abiding institution, it has acquired an existence
              of its own, a destiny beyond the grasp of its handlers.</span

              magnetometers and other instruments revealed unknown details about
              each of the four giant planets and their moons. Close-up images
              from the spacecraft charted Jupiter's complex cloud forms, winds
              and storm systems and discovered volcanic activity on its moon Io.
              Saturn's rings were found to have enigmatic braids, kinks and
              spokes and to be accompanied by myriad "ringlets".</span

            <h1>Voyager 1</h1>
            <p>
              <span
                >Voyager 1 is a space probe launched by NASA on September 5,
                1977, as part of the Voyager program to study the outer Solar
                System and the interstellar space beyond the Sun's heliosphere.
                It was launched 16 days after its twin, Voyager 2. It
                communicates through the NASA Deep Space Network (DSN) to
                receive routine commands and to transmit data to Earth.
                Real-time distance and velocity data are provided by NASA and
                JPL.[4] At a distance of 162.7 AU (24.3 billion km; 15.1 billion
                mi) from Earth as of May 2024,[4] it is the most distant
                humanmade object from Earth.[5] The probe made flybys of
                Jupiter, Saturn, and Saturn's largest moon, Titan. NASA had a
                choice of either doing a Pluto or Titan flyby; exploration of
                the moon took priority because it was known to have a
                substantial atmosphere.[6][7][8] Voyager 1 studied the weather,
                magnetic fields, and rings of the two gas giants and was the
                first probe to provide detailed images of their moons.</span
              >
              <span
                >As part of the Voyager program and like its sister craft
                Voyager 2, the spacecraft's extended mission is to locate and
                study the regions and boundaries of the outer heliosphere and to
                begin exploring the interstellar medium. Voyager 1 crossed the
                heliopause and entered interstellar space on August 25, 2012,
                making it the first spacecraft to do so.[9][10] Two years later,
                Voyager 1 began experiencing a third wave of coronal mass
                ejections from the Sun that continued to at least December 15,
                2014, further confirming that the probe is in interstellar
                space.</span
              >
              <span
                >In 2017, the Voyager team successfully fired the spacecraft's
                trajectory correction maneuver (TCM) thrusters for the first
                time since 1980, enabling the mission to be extended by two to
                three years.[12] Voyager 1's extended mission is expected to
                continue to return science data until at least 2025, with a
                maximum lifespan of until 2030.[13] Its radioisotope
                thermoelectric generators (RTGs) may supply enough electric
                power to return engineering data until 2036.</span

                >Voyager 2 is a space probe launched by NASA on August 20, 1977,
                as a part of the Voyager program. It was launched on a
                trajectory toward the gas giants Jupiter and Saturn and enabled
                further encounters with the ice giants Uranus and Neptune. It
                remains the only spacecraft to have visited either of the ice
                giant planets, and was the third of five spacecraft to achieve
                Solar escape velocity, which will allow it to leave the Solar
                System. It has been sending scientific data to Earth for 46
                years, 9 months, 16 days, making it the oldest active space
                probe. Launched 16 days before its twin Voyager 1, the primary
                mission of the spacecraft was to study the outer planets and its
                extended mission is to study interstellar space beyond the Sun's
                heliosphere.</span
              >
              <span
                >Voyager 2 successfully fulfilled its primary mission of
                visiting the Jovian system in 1979, the Saturnian system in
                1981, Uranian system in 1986, and the Neptunian system in 1989.
                The spacecraft is now in its extended mission of studying the
                interstellar medium. It is at a distance of 136.1 AU (20.4
                billion km; 12.7 billion mi) from Earth as of May 2024.[</span

              <span
                >The probe entered the interstellar medium on November 5, 2018,
                at a distance of 119.7 AU (11.1 billion mi; 17.9 billion km)
                from the Sun[5] and moving at a velocity of 15.341 km/s (34,320
                mph)[6] relative to the Sun. Voyager 2 has left the Sun's
                heliosphere and is traveling through the interstellar medium,
                though still inside the Solar System, joining Voyager 1, which
                had reached the interstellar medium in 2012.[7][8][9][10]
                Voyager 2 has begun to provide the first direct measurements of
                the density and temperature of the interstellar plasma.</span
