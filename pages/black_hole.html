          <h1>Black Hole</h1>
          <p>
            <span
              >A black hole is a region of spacetime where gravity is so strong
              that nothing, not even light and other electromagnetic waves, is
              capable of possessing enough energy to escape it. Einstein's
              theory of general relativity predicts that a sufficiently compact
              mass can deform spacetime to form a black hole. The boundary of no
              escape is called the event horizon. A black hole has a great
              effect on the fate and circumstances of an object crossing it, but
              it has no locally detectable features according to general
              relativity. In many ways, a black hole acts like an ideal black
              body, as it reflects no light. Quantum field theory in curved
              spacetime predicts that event horizons emit Hawking radiation,
              with the same spectrum as a black body of a temperature inversely
              proportional to its mass. This temperature is of the order of
              billionths of a kelvin for stellar black holes, making it
              essentially impossible to observe directly.</span
            >
            <span
              >Objects whose gravitational fields are too strong for light to
              escape were first considered in the 18th century by John Michell
              and Pierre-Simon Laplace. In 1916, Karl Schwarzschild found the
              first modern solution of general relativity that would
              characterize a black hole. David Finkelstein, in 1958, first
              published the interpretation of "black hole" as a region of space
              from which nothing can escape. Black holes were long considered a
              mathematical curiosity; it was not until the 1960s that
              theoretical work showed they were a generic prediction of general
              relativity. The discovery of neutron stars by Jocelyn Bell Burnell
              in 1967 sparked interest in gravitationally collapsed compact
              objects as a possible astrophysical reality. The first black hole
              known was Cygnus X-1, identified by several researchers
              independently in 1971.</span
            >
            <span
              >Black holes of stellar mass form when massive stars collapse at
              the end of their life cycle. After a black hole has formed, it can
              grow by absorbing mass from its surroundings. Supermassive black
              holes of millions of solar masses (M☉) may form by absorbing other
              stars and merging with other black holes, or via direct collapse
              of gas clouds. There is consensus that supermassive black holes
              exist in the centres of most galaxies.</span
            >
            <span
              >The presence of a black hole can be inferred through its
              interaction with other matter and with electromagnetic radiation
              such as visible light. Any matter that falls toward a black hole
              can form an external accretion disk heated by friction, forming
              quasars, some of the brightest objects in the universe. Stars
              passing too close to a supermassive black hole can be shredded
              into streamers that shine very brightly before being
              "swallowed."[11] If other stars are orbiting a black hole, their
              orbits can be used to determine the black hole's mass and
              location. Such observations can be used to exclude possible
              alternatives such as neutron stars. In this way, astronomers have
              identified numerous stellar black hole candidates in binary
              systems and established that the radio source known as Sagittarius
              A*, at the core of the Milky Way galaxy, contains a supermassive
              black hole of about 4.3 million solar masses.</span

            <h1>Properties and Structure</h1>
            <p>
              <span
                >The no-hair theorem postulates that, once it achieves a stable
                condition after formation, a black hole has only three
                independent physical properties: mass, electric charge, and
                angular momentum; the black hole is otherwise featureless. If
                the conjecture is true, any two black holes that share the same
                values for these properties, or parameters, are
                indistinguishable from one another. The degree to which the
                conjecture is true for real black holes under the laws of modern
                physics is currently an unsolved problem.</span
              >
              <span
                >These properties are special because they are visible from
                outside a black hole. For example, a charged black hole repels
                other like charges just like any other charged object.
                Similarly, the total mass inside a sphere containing a black
                hole can be found by using the gravitational analog of Gauss's
                law (through the ADM mass), far away from the black hole.
                Likewise, the angular momentum (or spin) can be measured from
                far away using frame dragging by the gravitomagnetic field,
                through for example the Lense–Thirring effect.</span
              >
              <span
                >When an object falls into a black hole, any information about
                the shape of the object or distribution of charge on it is
                evenly distributed along the horizon of the black hole, and is
                lost to outside observers. The behavior of the horizon in this
                situation is a dissipative system that is closely analogous to
                that of a conductive stretchy membrane with friction and
                electrical resistance—the membrane paradigm.[69] This is
                different from other field theories such as electromagnetism,
                which do not have any friction or resistivity at the microscopic
                level, because they are time-reversible.</span
              >
              <span
                >Because a black hole eventually achieves a stable state with
                only three parameters, there is no way to avoid losing
                information about the initial conditions: the gravitational and
                electric fields of a black hole give very little information
                about what went in. The information that is lost includes every
                quantity that cannot be measured far away from the black hole
                horizon, including approximately conserved quantum numbers such
                as the total baryon number and lepton number. This behavior is
                so puzzling that it has been called the black hole information
                loss paradox</span

              <span
                >Rotating black holes are surrounded by a region of spacetime in
                which it is impossible to stand still, called the ergosphere.
                This is the result of a process known as frame-dragging; general
                relativity predicts that any rotating mass will tend to slightly
                "drag" along the spacetime immediately surrounding it. Any
                object near the rotating mass will tend to start moving in the
                direction of rotation. For a rotating black hole, this effect is
                so strong near the event horizon that an object would have to
                move faster than the speed of light in the opposite direction to
                just stand still.</span
              >
              <span
                >The ergosphere of a black hole is a volume bounded by the black
                hole's event horizon and the ergosurface, which coincides with
                the event horizon at the poles but is at a much greater distance
                around the equator.</span
              >
              <span
                >Objects and radiation can escape normally from the ergosphere.
                Through the Penrose process, objects can emerge from the
                ergosphere with more energy than they entered with. The extra
                energy is taken from the rotational energy of the black hole.
                Thereby the rotation of the black hole slows down.[120] A
                variation of the Penrose process in the presence of strong
                magnetic fields, the Blandford–Znajek process is considered a
                likely mechanism for the enormous luminosity and relativistic
                jets of quasars and other active galactic nuclei.</span
